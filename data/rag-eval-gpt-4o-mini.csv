1. **Stress urinary incontinence**: This occurs when urine leaks due to pressure on the bladder from activities such as exercise, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or lifting heavy objects.

2. **Urgency urinary incontinence**: This happens when individuals experience a sudden and overwhelming urge to urinate, leading to leakage before they can reach the toilet.

3. **Mixed urinary incontinence**: This is a combination of stress and urgency urinary incontinence, where individuals may leak urine due to both physical pressure and sudden urges.

4. **Overflow urinary incontinence**: This type occurs when small amounts of urine leak from a bladder that is overly full. It can be caused by issues such as an enlarged prostate in men, diabetes, or spinal cord injury.

5. **Functional urinary incontinence**: This occurs in individuals, particularly older adults, who may be unable to reach the bathroom in time due to mobility issues or other conditions like arthritis.
